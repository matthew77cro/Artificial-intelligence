1. Algorithmic complexity of my implementation for functions checking whether the heuristic is 
	-> consistent - O() 
	-> optimistic - O(|S| * b^(1+floor(C*/Îµ)))
	
2. Optimism checking can be optimised:
	-> when cost from the start to the end state is calculated, we can in O(1) determine cost from any state on
	   that optimal path to the end (instead of calculating the optimal path from each of those states anew)
	-> or we can use Djikstra's algorithm => new time complexity = O(V^2) or O(V+ElogV) using min-priority queue,
	   where V is the number of vertices (states) and E is the numeber of edges (transitions)
